To develop an AI prediction model on AI adoption at CUT using Python Django, you'll need to create a web application that allows users to upload data, train the model, and visualize the results on a dashboard. Additionally, you'll integrate an OpenRouter API key to enhance functionality, such as providing suggestions from the output and improving the app's features. Below is a structured prompt to guide you through this development process:

### Prompt for Developing an AI Prediction Model on AI Adoption at CUT Using Python Django

#### Objective:
Create a Django web application that allows users to upload data, train an AI prediction model, and visualize the results on a dashboard. The application should also integrate an OpenRouter API key to enhance functionality, such as providing suggestions from the output and improving the app's features.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Django Project:**
   - Create a new Django project and application.
   - Configure the project settings, including database configuration and static files handling.

2. **Data Upload Functionality:**
   - Create a Django form to allow users to upload CSV files containing data for training the model.
   - Implement a view to handle the file upload and save the data to the database.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Develop a machine learning model using a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) to predict AI adoption at CUT.
   - Create a Django view to train the model using the uploaded data.
   - Save the trained model to a file or database for future use.

4. **Dashboard for Visualization:**
   - Design a dashboard using Django templates to display the results of the model training.
   - Include visualizations such as graphs and charts to represent the model's predictions and performance metrics.

5. **Integrate OpenRouter API:**
   - Obtain an OpenRouter API key and configure it in your Django settings.
   - Use the OpenRouter API to enhance the application's functionality, such as providing suggestions based on the model's output.
   - Implement API calls in your Django views to fetch and display suggestions.

6. **Continuous Training:**
   - Develop functionality to retrain the model with new data uploaded by users.
   - Update the dashboard to reflect the latest model training results.

7. **User Interface Enhancements:**
   - Improve the user interface to make it intuitive and user-friendly.
   - Add features such as user authentication, error handling, and notifications.

8. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the application works as expected.
   - Deploy the Django application to a production server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

#### Example Code Snippets:

**1. Setting Up Django Project:**
```bash
django-admin startproject ai_adoption_predictor
cd ai_adoption_predictor
python manage.py startapp prediction
```

**2. Data Upload Form (forms.py):**
```python
from django import forms

class DataUploadForm(forms.Form):
    file = forms.FileField()
```

**3. View to Handle File Upload (views.py):**
```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import DataUploadForm
import pandas as pd

def upload_data(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DataUploadForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            file = request.FILES['file']
            data = pd.read_csv(file)
            # Save data to the database or process it
            return redirect('success')
    else:
        form = DataUploadForm()
    return render(request, 'upload.html', {'form': form})
```

**4. Model Training View (views.py):**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

def train_model(request):
    # Load data from the database
    data = pd.read_csv('path_to_data.csv')
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Save the trained model
    joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')

    return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {'accuracy': model.score(X_test, y_test)})
```

**5. Integrate OpenRouter API (views.py):**
```python
import requests
from django.conf import settings

def get_suggestions(output):
    api_key = settings.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
    url = 'https://api.openrouter.ai/suggestions'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    response = requests.post(url, json={'output': output}, headers=headers)
    suggestions = response.json()
    return suggestions
```

**6. Dashboard Template (dashboard.html):**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>AI Adoption Prediction Dashboard</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>AI Adoption Prediction Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Model Accuracy: {{ accuracy }}</p>
    <div id="visualizations">
        <!-- Add visualizations here -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Conclusion:
By following these steps, you will create a robust Django web application that allows users to upload data, train an AI prediction model, and visualize the results on a dashboard. Integrating the OpenRouter API will enhance the application's functionality, making it more useful and interactive.
